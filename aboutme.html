        <p> My name is Abay. I was born in Astana and I still live here.
        <p> Currently, I am studying 1st course in Astana IT University 
            <br> and to be honest I am very interested in my profession. 
            My interest in Software Engineering began at the beginning of last year in high school when I first came into contact with coding in school.
            <br> I was coding computer game using Python PL. From there on, I was captivated. 
            <br>I started coding everyday and working on small projects of my own, creating games, researching neural net and writing telegram bots. </p>
